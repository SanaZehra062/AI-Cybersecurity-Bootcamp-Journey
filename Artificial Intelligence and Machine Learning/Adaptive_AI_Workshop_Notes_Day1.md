# Building Adaptive AI: Workshop Notes
## Workshop Overview
This workshop focused on the concept of Building Adaptive AI, where the overall learning process was explained as a journey divided into five main phases. These phases start from understanding the basics and gradually move towards advanced implementation, finally ending with a capstone project where everything learned is applied practically.<br>
The first session was mainly about setting the foundation. It was clearly mentioned that the workshop is designed in a step-by-step manner, meaning each session builds on the previous one. If the basics are not clear, the advanced parts may become difficult later. Participants were encouraged to stay attentive, actively take part in discussions, and ask questions whenever something felt unclear.<br>
## AI vs Machine Learning
A clear distinction was made between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to remove common confusion:<br>
* Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broader concept. It focuses on creating systems that can think, learn, and make decisions in a way similar to humans. One important point discussed was that AI systems aim to retain learned knowledge instead of forgetting it.<br>
* Machine Learning (ML) is a part of AI. It allows systems to learn from data and improve performance over time. However, when new data is introduced, older learned patterns may be replaced, which means ML models can sometimes forget previous information.<br>
* Machine Learning is mainly used for pattern recognition, classification, and prediction, while AI focuses on creating intelligent and adaptive behavior.<br>
This comparison helped in understanding where ML fits inside the broader AI domain.<br>
## Tools and Technologies Discussed
The session also introduced the tools and technologies that will be used throughout the workshop and in the final project. Each tool was explained along with its purpose:<br>
* **Google Colab:**
An online platform that allows writing and executing Python code directly in the browser without installing anything locally. It is especially useful for machine learning experiments.<br>
* **Python:**
The primary programming language used due to its simplicity and strong support for AI and ML libraries.<br>
* **NumPy:**
Used for numerical computations and handling large datasets efficiently using arrays.<br>
* **Matplotlib:**
A visualization library used to plot graphs and display images, which helps in understanding data patterns.<br>
* **TensorFlow and Keras:**
Powerful libraries used for building, training, and testing machine learning and deep learning models.<br>
We were guided step by step to set up their Google Colab environment, create a new notebook, and get ready for upcoming practical sessions.<br>
## Machine Learning Practice in Google Colab
A hands-on training session was conducted to apply the concepts practically using Google Colab. During this session:<br>
* Required libraries were imported into the notebook.<br>
* The concept of tensors was introduced and explained.<br>
* The MNIST dataset (handwritten digit images) was loaded using Keras.<br>
* The structure of the dataset was explored to understand how image data is stored.<br>
* Tensors were converted into images for better visualization.<br>
* Different index values were used to display different images and observe variations.<br>
This practice session helped in understanding how raw data is loaded, processed, and visualized before being used to train a machine learning model.
