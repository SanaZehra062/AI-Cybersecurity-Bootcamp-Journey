 # Cloud Computing Fundamentals
 ## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing means using computing resources (servers, storage, databases, applications) over the internet instead of owning physical hardware.<br>
### Key Points:<br>
•	No need to buy or maintain physical servers<br>
•	Resources are rented from cloud providers<br>
•	Pay-as-you-go pricing (pay only for what you use)<br>

 ## Major Cloud Service Providers
•	Amazon Web Services (AWS)<br>
•	Microsoft Azure<br>
•	Google Cloud Platform (GCP)<br>

# Microsoft Azure
### Azure Overview
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform by Microsoft that provides a wide range of services to build, deploy, and manage applications.<br>

### Azure Service Models
•	**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**<br>
Virtual machines, storage, networking with full control<br>
•	**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**<br>
Application hosting without managing hardware<br>
•	**Software as a Service (SaaS)**<br>
Ready-to-use cloud software<br>

### Azure Pricing Model
•	Mostly pay-as-you-go<br>
•	You pay only for the resources you use<br>

 ### Azure Virtual Machines
•	Cloud-based virtual servers<br>
•	Create custom VMs or use pre-built templates<br>
•	Full control over the operating system<br>

### Azure Storage
•	Secure cloud storage for:<br>
o	Application data<br>
o	Backup data<br>

### Azure App Services
•	Scalable platform for web applications<br>
•	Fully managed environment<br>
•	Easy deployment and scaling<br>

###  Azure Functions
•	Serverless, event-driven computing<br>
•	No server management required<br>

 ### Azure Containers
•	Azure Container Instances<br>
•	Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)<br>

### Azure Databases
•	Fully managed relational and NoSQL databases<br>
•	Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL APIs<br>

### Azure AI and Machine Learning
•	Tools to build, train, and deploy ML models<br>
•	Supports AI and data science workloads<br>

### Azure Global Infrastructure
•	Worldwide data centers<br>
•	Better performance and low latency<br>

### Azure Portal
•	Web-based interface<br>
•	Manage and monitor all Azure resources in one place<br>

# Azure Services:
## 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the practice of utilizing computing resources—such as servers, storage, and databases—over the internet. This model allows organizations to operate without the need to own or maintain physical hardware. Azure serves as one of the major global cloud platforms providing these essential services.<br>
## 2. Core Service Categories
### AI and Machine Learning
•	**Definition:** Tools used to create and deploy intelligent applications using AI techniques.<br>
•	**Key Services:** Cognitive Services provide pre-built capabilities like vision, speech, and language (e.g., Computer Vision API for image analysis).<br>
•	**Example:** Developing a chatbot using Azure Bot Service integrated with Cognitive Services.<br>
### Analytics
•	**Definition:** Tools designed to analyze large datasets to discover useful patterns for decision-making.<br>
•	**Key Services:** Azure Synapse Analytics (unified big data and warehousing) and Power BI (interactive business visualizations).<br>
•	**Example:** Using Azure Synapse to analyze sales data and Power BI to visualize trends and forecasts.<br>
### Compute
•	**Definition:** Services providing the processing power required to run applications and workloads.<br>
•	**Key Services:** Virtual Machines (VMs) for on-demand scalable hardware and Azure Functions for serverless, event-driven code execution.<br>
•	**Example:** Running a web server on a VM or processing image uploads via Azure Functions.<br>
### Databases
•	**Definition:** Managed services for storing and managing application data.<br>
•	**Key Services:** Azure SQL Database (fully managed relational database) and Azure Cosmos DB (globally distributed, multi-model database).<br>
•	**Example:** Using SQL Database for transactional apps and Cosmos DB for global web apps needing fast data access.<br>
### Storage
•	**Definition:** Dedicated services for the long-term management of data.<br>
•	**Key Services:** Azure Blob Storage for large amounts of unstructured data (text/binary) and Azure File Storage for managed file shares using the SMB protocol.<br>
•	**Example:** Storing user images in Blob Storage or using File Storage for shared network drives.<br>
## 3. Specialized Solutions and Infrastructure
 •	**Migration:** Services like Azure Migrate provide a centralized hub to discover, assess, and move on-premises workloads and VMs to the cloud.<br>
 •	**Identity:** Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) manages user identities and controls access to internal and external resources (e.g., Microsoft 365) via Single Sign-On (SSO).<br>
•	**DevOps:** Tools to speed up development and deployment. Includes Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines and GitHub Actions for automated workflows.<br>
•	**Internet of Things (IoT):** Services for managing devices that collect data. Azure IoT Hub acts as a central message hub, while Azure IoT Central is a hosted SaaS (Software as a Service) solution for managing assets at scale.<br>
•	**Networking:** Infrastructure for connecting resources. Virtual Network (VNet) provides isolated environments, and Azure ExpressRoute creates private, high-speed connections that bypass the public internet.<br>
•	**Security:** Protections for apps and data. Azure Security Center offers unified management, while Azure DDoS Protection safeguards against attacks intended to make resources unavailable.<br>
•	**Web and Mobile:** Focused on app hosting. Azure App Service is a managed platform for web apps, while Azure Mobile Apps provides back-end functionality like push notifications.<br>
